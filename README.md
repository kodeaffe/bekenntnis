A little learning project to play with Rocket, Diesel and Askama.
This is heavily inspired by [Late night confessions](https://medium.com/perimeterx/late-night-confessions-building-a-website-using-rust-rocket-diesel-and-askama-part-1-aeccade43252) by Johnny Tordgeman.


## Quickstart

Just execute `cargo run` to fire up the web server and visit the site in your browser via http://localhost:7878 . `7878` means `rust` when typing on the phone.

Modify [Rocket.toml](Rocket.toml) for configuration changes.
